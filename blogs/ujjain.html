                    Shipra River, also known as Kshipra River is one of the holy rivers according to Hinduism and hence,
                    attracts huge rush of pilgrims and tourists curious to observe the Hinduism closely. The river even
                    finds mention in the religious texts of Hindus, and has scores of prominent temples on its ghats.
                    One of the major reasons why this river is so hugely popular is that the famous Kumbh Mela is held
                    once in every 12 years on one of its ghats – Ram Ghat.

                    During the mela, lacs of pilgrims take a dip in the sacred waters of this river at Ram Ghat. It is
                    believed that taking a dip here purifies one’s soul and body, and is one of the best things to do in
                    Ujjain. Even if you cannot attend Kumbh Mela, do take a dip here to experience the divinity of
                    Shipra River.
